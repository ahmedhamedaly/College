GIVEN : module FiniteStateMachine (output out_z, input in_x, in_y, clk, reset_b);

This is to create a circuit described in the state which is shown in the question

it has to change every falling edge of the clock and the machine should change state on the rising edge

i designed it so it should enter the state at 00 of the negative edge of the reset signal
see notes for more detail
