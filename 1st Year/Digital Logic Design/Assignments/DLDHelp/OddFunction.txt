GIVEN: module OddFunction (output A, input x, y, clk, reset_b);

You have to module the same output states as the diagram in the question

this could be done by entering state 0 at a negative edge of the reset and continuing to reach the last state which is 1

the signal waves in the question is very helpful try to understand it
