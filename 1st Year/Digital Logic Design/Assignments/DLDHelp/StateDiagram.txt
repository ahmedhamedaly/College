GIVEN: module StateDiagram(output y_out, input x_in, clk, reset_b);

The output should be a finite state machine which has an input of input x and input y_out

x changes from 0 to 1 and y is the 3 cycles.

keep note that text data will change on the falling edge of the clock and your machine.

your design should enter state 0 to negative edge of the reset signal (check notes)
